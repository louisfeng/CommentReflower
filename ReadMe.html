  <h1>ReadMe for Comment Reflower for Visual Studio 2010</h1>
  <p>This is a quick &amp; dirty port of Ian Nowland's extremely useful CommentReflower plugin for Visual Studio 2003 and 2005. You can find the original distribution at the <a href="http://commentreflower.sourceforge.net/">Comment Reflower home page</a>.</p>
  <p>This port was first cobbled together by Christoph Nahr in June 2008, with several <a href="#History">later revisions</a>. I have no connection whatsoever with Ian Nowland and no experience with Visual Studio add-ins either, but since he hasn’t updated Comment Reflower in years I decided to give it a shot. Since I cannot update the original SourceForge project I’ve put my version up for download <a href="http://www.kynosarges.de/CommentReflower.html">at my own website</a>.</p>
  <h2>Deployment</h2>
  <p>Comment Reflower supports XCopy deployment. Simply extract the entire contents of the current binary package, <code>CommentReflower.zip</code>, to one of the directories that Visual Studio searches for add-ins. You can find the complete list of supported locations under Tools > Options > Environment > Add-in/Macros Security within Visual Studio 2010. See the MSDN page <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1326zbk3.aspx">Visual Studio 2010 Add-In Security</a> for further details.</p>
  <p>As an example, here is a possible location for a user-specific installation. Substitute your Windows user name for <em>&lt;User Name&gt;</em> to get the actual directory:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>\Documents and Settings\<em>&lt;User Name&gt;</em>\My Documents\Visual Studio 2010\AddIns (on Windows XP)</li>
    <li>\Users\<em>&lt;User Name&gt;</em>\(My) Documents\Visual Studio 2010\AddIns (on Windows Vista and later)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You will find the following files in your deployment folder:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>CommentReflower.Addin – The mandatory add-in control file for Visual Studio 2010.</li>
    <li>CommentReflower.dll &amp; CommentReflowerLib.dll – The two .NET assemblies that constitute the add-in, compiled in release mode.</li>
    <li>CommentReflower.chm – The HTML Help file for the Comment Reflower Settings dialog in the Visual Studio Tools menu.</li>
    <li>CommentReflowerReadMe.html – This file. The source package includes the same file under the name ReadMe.html.</li>
    <li>CommentReflowerSetup.xml – The settings file created by the Comment Reflower Settings dialog.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The settings file is not part of the distribution package but will be created the first time you use the Settings dialog. If you have a settings file from an older version of Comment Reflower, you can simply copy it to the deployment folder.</p>
  <h2>Changes from the June 2008 Version</h2>
  <p>All files required to run the add-in are now expected in the same deployment folder, which must be one of the Visual Studio\AddIns folders listed above. This has the following consequences:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Simpler deployment from a separate binary package – you no longer need to unpack the entire source code package and manually edit the assembly location in the add-in control file.</li>
    <li>Online help available for the Comment Reflower Settings dialog – the Help button and the F1 shortcut key now work as expected, since Comment Reflower no longer attempts to find the HTML Help file using a nonexistent registry key.</li>
    <li>Changed location of the settings file – this is the one change that requires some work on your part.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you’re upgrading from the June 2008 version, you will want to copy your existing settings file to the new location. Substituting your user name for <em>&lt;User Name&gt;</em> and your Visual Studio version number for <em>&lt;Version&gt;</em>, you can find your old settings file at the following location (on Windows Vista):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>\Users\<em>&lt;User Name&gt;</em>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft Corporation\Microsoft&reg; Visual Studio&reg; 2008\<em>&lt;Version&gt;</em>\CommentReflowerSetup.xml</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Changes from the Original Version and Usage Details</h2>
  <p>The following list shows all projects in the original 2005 distribution and what happened to them in the current source code package, <code>CommentReflowerSource.zip</code>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>CommentReflower – The library assembly that connects the add-in to the Visual Studio IDE. Rewritten for Visual Studio 2010 with some changes as described below.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>CommentReflowerHelp – The HTML Help 1.3 project that generates the help file. Updated to reflect the new command names and put in the root directory, otherwise unchanged. This project is not attached to the Visual Studio solution and must be built manually. The project folder already contains a prebuilt CHM file, however.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>CommentReflowerLib – The library assembly that provides the actual reflowing logic. Unchanged.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>CommentReflowerTest – A command-line executable that tests the CommentReflowerLib assembly. Unchanged, except that the command-line window now waits for a keystroke before closing. Check the execution directory in the project properties before attempting to run this project!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>CommentReflowerResourceDll – A resource assembly providing a few command icons which are frankly quite ugly. Not included in this distribution; all commands are shown as text only.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>CommentReflowerSetup – The setup project that creates the MSI distribution package. Not included in this distribution since I have no experience with the MSI technology and don’t know how to upgrade this project to VS2010 so that it actually runs on someone else’s machine. Ian Nowland’s original ReadMe.rtf file is located in the root directory, however.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The settings file used to reside in LocalUserAppData, then moved to UserAppData in the June 2008 revision, i.e. the “Roaming” version of the same directory; and finally to the AddIns folder in the January 2009 revision.</p>
  <p>Some internal names have changed as well. The CommentReflower add-in name is now simply CommentReflower.Connect, with no version suffix such as 2003, 2005, or 2008. Its GUID has changed as well, although it is currently unused. The command names provided by Comment Reflower were shortened and changed to the standard verb form, as follows:</p>
  <table border="true">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Command</th>
        <th>Internal Name</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
      <td>Align Parameters at Cursor</td>
      <td>CommentReflower.Connect.AlignParameters</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Reflow Comment at Cursor</td>
      <td>CommentReflower.Connect.ReflowPoint</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Reflow All Comments in Selection</td>
      <td>CommentReflower.Connect.ReflowSelection</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Comment Reflower Settings</td>
      <td>CommentReflower.Connect.Settings</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Each command has a corresponding entry in the Tools menu, and except for Settings also in the context menu of the code editor window. Moreover, each command can be bound to a keyboard shortcut using the Tools: Options: Keyboard dialog. The AlignParameters command is unavailable by default, and must be enabled explicitly using the “Enable Align Params” button in the Settings dialog.</p>
  <p><b>Note:</b> Comment Reflower does not support block comments with non-empty Block Start &amp; Block End fields but an empty (or whitespace) Line Start field, e.g. traditional C-style block comments without leading asterisks on each line. Apparently the comment matching algorithm cannot detect such a combination. Try using the “Empty Block for Text Files” style instead if you require a style without Line Start characters.</p>
