Comment Reflower has two ways of operation. It can either work on a single block or on all blocks that intersection with a sect.ion<BR>
<BR>
To reflow a single block place the cursor on any line within the block and from the <B>Tools</B> menu select
<B>Reflow Comment at Cursor</B>. Alternatively right click to bring up the context menu and select
<B>Reflow Comment at Cursor</B>.<BR>
<BR>
To reflow all blocks in a selection first select the text. Note all comments that intersect this text will be
reflowed - not just the parts of them that are within the selection. Then from the <B>Tools</B> menu select
<B>Reflow All Comments in Selection</B>. Alternatively right click to bring up the context menu and select
<B>Reflow All Comments in Selection</B>.<BR>

If these menu items are not enabled then this file does not have any comment block file associations.<BR>
